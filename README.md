A moderation, translation, and poll bot designed to make life easier.

## Moderation Features
Neptune, like most bots, has many moderation features. It has a configurable auto-mute system, and provides a simple and intuitive punishment configuration.

## Fun Commands
Like any good bot, Neptune has some unique commands. These include a reddit command, to view memes with your friends, weird facts, and more.

Of course, Neptune is not made to be just like any other bot. There are constantly new features being added, such as automatic translation, image commands, and more to come!
